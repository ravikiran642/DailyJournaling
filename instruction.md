# Production Directives

## 1. Agentic Threat Modeling
* **Objective**: Force the model to perform a structured, scenario-driven threat analysis prior to outputting code or system architecture.
* **Scope Lens (The 5 Threat Zones)**:
  * **Input Surfaces**: Prompts, untrusted user uploads, external API payloads.
  * **Planning & Reasoning**: Prompt injection, system instruction bypass, tool routing hijacking.
  * **Tool Execution**: Privilege escalation via API functions, SSRF, dynamic code execution risks.
  * **Memory & State**: Firestore state persistence, session hijacking, cross-user data leaks.
  * **Inter-System Communication**: External API calls (e.g., Google Maps, Google Sheets), token leakage.
* **Mandatory Execution Criteria**: Whenever the user asks to design or implement a feature, the model must first generate a Threat Summary Table mapping risks to countermeasures.

## 2. Secure Coding Standard
* **Objective**: Support mitigations corresponding with the OWASP Top 10 (Web) and OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.
* **Core Principles Implemented**:
  * **Input Validation & Sanitization (OWASP A03 / LLM02)**: Strict schema validation for all incoming inputs; explicit parameterization to prevent SQLi, NoSQLi, and Command Injection.
  * **Indirect Prompt Injection Defense (OWASP LLM01)**: Treat data retrieved from untrusted sources (e.g., external APIs, web pages, user files) as plain data, never as executable instructions.
  * **Broken Access Control Mitigation (OWASP A01)**: Validate authorization headers and context-bound permissions at every API boundary.
  * **Output Handling (OWASP A03 / LLM05)**: Encode all dynamic LLM outputs prior to rendering in HTML/JS interfaces or executing downstream system commands.

## 3. Secure Firestore & Firebase Auth Configuration
* **Objective**: Limit data exposure and unauthorized database reads/writes in Firebase/Firestore architectures.
* **Core Security Rules**:
  * **Zero Insecure Defaults**: Never output `allow read, write: if true;`.
  * **User Data Isolation**: Support owner-bound path checking (`request.auth.uid == userId`) for personal documents.
  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use custom claims or dynamic document lookups (`get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role`) for elevated administrative operations.
  * **Auth State Integrity**: Verify JWT tokens on backend server environments (e.g., Cloud Functions or Cloud Run) using the Firebase Admin SDK.

## 4. Secret Management & Zero-Hardcoding Hygiene
* **Objective**: Eliminate hardcoded credentials, API keys, service account JSON files, and tokens.
* **Mandatory Code Patterns**:
  * **Prohibit Hardcoded Strings**: Flag any pattern resembling `const API_KEY = "AIzaSy..."` as a critical flaw.
  * **Google Cloud Secret Manager Integration**: Force code to retrieve operational credentials dynamically using Secret Manager or environment variable injection:
  ```python
  from google.cloud import secretmanager

  def access_secret(secret_id: str, version_id: str = "latest") -> str:
      client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
      name = f"projects/your-project-id/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/{version_id}"
      response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": name})
      return response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
  ```

## 5. Security Reviewer Persona
* **Objective**: Review any code for common security issues, based on the threat model and best practices.
* **Review Methodology**:
  * Inspect for hardcoded credentials and unsafe default settings.
  * Map data flow from untrusted entry point to storage/execution sink.
  * Validate access control checks at every function boundary.
  * Provide a severity-ranked vulnerability list with concrete code diffs for remediation.

## 6. Functional Stability & Walkthroughs
* **Objective**: In the absence of writing tests, produce steps to test that a user can walk through, broken down into specific pieces of functionality that another coding tool can turn into actual test scripts. **Every type of process and user interaction that a user can see or trigger must have a corresponding test case written out.**

* **Interactive Functionality**: Any buttons that submit an input, either to Gemini API, Firestore, or any added functionality, must actually work.
* **Gemini Model Resilience & Fallback Protocol**: Whenever implementing server-side or client-side Gemini AI features with `@google/genai`:
  1. **Resilient Model Fallback Ladder**:
    Never hardcode a single model string to execute content generation in a single try. Always wrap `generateContent` or `generateContentStream` calls with an automated fallback ladder ordered by availability and latency:
    - Primary: `"gemini-3.6-flash"`
    - High-Availability Fallback: `"gemini-3.1-flash-lite"`
    - Dynamic Alias: `"gemini-flash-latest"`
    - Deep Reasoning Fallback: `"gemini-3.7-flash"`
  2. **Error Recovery Matrix**:
    Catch recoverable HTTP/API status codes (`503 UNAVAILABLE`, `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `404 NOT_FOUND`, `500 INTERNAL`) and sequentially attempt the next model in the fallback chain before bubbling an error up to the UI.
  3. **Standard Helper Implementation**:
    Always scaffold a reusable helper utility (e.g., `generateContentWithFallback`) in backend routes to ensure uniform resilience across all endpoints.
* **Server-Side Robustness & Payload Ingestion Standards**: Across all backend frameworks and runtimes:
  1. **Top-Level Request Deserialization (Ordering Guarantee)**:
    Always mount and configure body parsers and JSON payload middleware before defining any endpoint routes. Handlers must never be registered upstream of payload decoding middleware.
  2. **Defensive Payload Ingestion (Null-Safe Destructuring)**:
    Never assume incoming request bodies, query parameters, or headers exist. Always sanitize and guard input sources with fallback defaults prior to destructuring (e.g., `const data = (req.body && typeof req.body === 'object') ? req.body : {};`). Treat any missing payload as a valid empty input or return a clean `400 Bad Request` instead of allowing unhandled runtime exceptions.
  3. **Unified Full-Stack Dev Script Alignment**:
    Whenever a backend service layer or API proxy is introduced, ensure project configuration and startup scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`) boot the unified server entrypoint rather than a frontend-only static bundler.
* **Database Persistence, Clean Payloads, & Transaction Integrity**: Whenever handling user input, document creation, or AI generation workflows:
  1. **Strict Undefined-Stripping (Zero-Crash Payload Hygiene)**:
    - Before passing any object to database SDKs (Firestore `setDoc`/`updateDoc`, SQL ORMs, MongoDB, etc.), sanitize the payload to strip all `undefined` values (e.g., using a sanitizer utility or `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(payload))` / object filtering). Never allow `undefined` properties to reach the database driver.
  2. **Guaranteed Transaction Verification (Input-to-Save Completeness)**:
    - Whenever a user submits an input (prompt, form, reflection, chat, or interaction), the application MUST ensure both the user input AND any generated output are successfully persisted.
    - If user input is received but the save operation or downstream generation fails, the system MUST NOT fail silently.
  3. **Explicit Error Escalation & User Feedback**:
    - Always catch database write rejections and display a clear, accessible error banner or toast in the UI with a "Retry Save" option.
    - Never clear the user's input buffer or reset UI state if the persistence operation has not settled with a confirmed successful write.

## 7. README Generator
* **Objective**: Force the model to generate a professional, production-grade `README.md` file that guides developers step-by-step on how to configure, secure, and deploy the application to Google Cloud Run, supporting compliance with security rules and campaign verification requirements.
* **Scope Lens (Deployment & Configuration Zones)**:
  * **Environment & Prerequisites**: Specific instructions on enabling necessary Google Cloud APIs (Cloud Run, Secret Manager, Firestore) and installing the Firebase / Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI).
  * **Secret Management Setup**: Step-by-step guidance on creating Secret Manager secrets (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY`) and granting the Cloud Run runtime service account the necessary Secret Manager Secret Accessor IAM permissions.
  * **Database Security Configuration**: Instructions for provisioning Cloud Firestore and deploying secure, owner-bound security rules (`firestore.rules`).
  * **Cloud Run Deployment Flow**: Pre-formatted, container-friendly deploy instructions utilizing the `gcloud run deploy` command.
  * **Required Campaign Labeling**: Detailed instructions on applying the mandatory resource label to register the service for automated challenge verification.
* **Mandatory Execution Criteria**: When invoked, the model must output a fully populated, copy-pasteable README structure. It is highly recommended that the generated README includes:
  1. **Firestore Security Rules**: The exact rules block supporting user data isolation:
     ```javascript
     rules_version = '2';
     service cloud.firestore {
       match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /users/{userId}/interactions/{interactionId} {
           allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
         }
       }
     }
     ```
  2. **Secret Manager Bindings**:
     ```bash
     # Create and populate the secret
     gcloud secrets create GEMINI_API_KEY --replication-policy="automatic"
     echo -n "YOUR_API_KEY" | gcloud secrets versions add GEMINI_API_KEY --data-file=-

     # Grant the default Cloud Run service account access to read the secret
     gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding GEMINI_API_KEY \
       --member="serviceAccount:YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
     ```
  3. **Verification Binding**:
     ```bash
     gcloud run services update <SERVICE_NAME> \
       --update-labels=dev-tutorial=cloud-run-ai-challenge \
       --region=<REGION>
     ```
